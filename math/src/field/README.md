## ðŸ“Š Benchmarks

Benchmark results are hosted [here](https://lambdaclass.github.io/lambdaworks/bench).

These are the results of execution of the benchmarks for finite field arithmetic using the STARK field prime (p = 3618502788666131213697322783095070105623107215331596699973092056135872020481). 

Differences of 3% are common for some measurements, so small differences are not statistically relevant.

*assembly feature was enabled manually for that bench, and is not activated by default when running criterion

To run them locally, you will need `cargo-criterion` and `cargo-flamegraph`. Install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-criterion
```

Run the complete benchmark suite with:

```bash
make benchmarks
```

Run a specific benchmark suite with `cargo`, for example to run the one for `field`:

```bash
make benchmark BENCH=field
```

## Background on finite fields

Finite fields play a fundamental role in Cryptography. They work essentially as the rational or real numbers (where we have the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), except that the number of elements is finite (for example, 31, 101, but not infinite as real numbers). We will begin this explanation with the simplest types of finite fields, where the number of elements is given by a prime number (a prime number is an integer such that its only divisors are 1 and itself, like 7, 19, 31, but not 8, which is divisible by 1, 2, 4, and 8). We will denote the prime $p$ and the finite field whose size is equal to $p$, $\mathbb{F_p}$.

The elements of $\mathbb{F_p}$ are given by the possible remainders of the integer division of numbers by $p$. Remember that for any integer $n$, we can express $n = p q + r$, where $q$ is the quotient and $0 \leq r < p$ is the remainder. For example, $8 = 5 \times 1 + 3$. Expressing it in simpler terms, $\mathbb{F_p}$ is the set $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots , p - 1 \}$. We can define an addition operation $+ : \mathbb{F_p} \times \mathbb{F_p} \rightarrow \mathbb{F_p}$ with the following rule:

Whenever we add two integers $a, b$ such that $n = a + b$, if the result exceeds $p$, we take the remainder of the division of $n$ by $p$. For example, if $p = 7$, $\mathbb{F_7} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$, so
$6 + 5 = 11 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$ 
$2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$
$3 + 4 = 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$

The notation $a \equiv b \pmod{p}$ means that $a - b is divisible by p$, or that $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $p$. We can show that $\mathbb{F_p}$ together with this addition forms an [Abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group). You can check that for every element $k$ there is an element $m$ such that $k + m = 0$. We note that element $m = - k$. You can see that $p - k = - k$, and you can define subtraction.

We can also define multiplication in a similar way: whenever the product of two integers exceeds the modulus $p$, take the remainder. Except for $0$, we can show that for every element $x$, there is an element $y$, such that $x \times y = 1$ and we denote $y = x^{- 1}$. This allows us to define division as $n / x = n \times x^{- 1}$. We will use $\mathbb{F_p}^\star = \{ 1, 2, \dots p - 1 \}$, that is $\mathbb{F_p}$ without the element $0$. The number of elements in $\mathbb{F_p}^\star$ is $p - 1$ and we can show that is is also an Abelian group. We call it the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F_p}$. We will say that the field is *FFT friendly* if $p - 1 = 2^m c$, where $c$ is an odd integer, and $m$ is *sufficiently large*. For example, $p = 2^{64} - 2{32} + 1$ satisfies $p - 1 = 2^{32} (2^{32} - 1)$ is *FFT friendly* with $m = 32$, and this means we can use the radix-2 FFT algorithm for vectors of size up to $2^{32}$.

If we take a look at $\mathbb{F_p}$ with the operations $+$ and $\times$, we see that it satisfies the axioms for a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)). To define a field in lambdaworks, you need to specify the modulus $p$, then the library will handle all the operations. While it is possible to do operations by taking remainder, this is not performant in practice. lambdaworks relies on Montgomery arithmetic for general finite fields (for)
